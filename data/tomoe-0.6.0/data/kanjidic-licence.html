<b>1. Introduction</b>

of the dictionary files assembled, coordinated and edited by him to the 
The Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group
at Monash University (hereafter "the Group"), on the understanding that 
the Group
will foster the development of the dictionary files, and will utilize all
monies received for use of the files for the further
development of the files, and for research into computer lexicography and
electronic dictionaries.
